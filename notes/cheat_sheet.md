`npx serve` - can be used to spin up a server for our projects. It will open up `localhost:5000` and `192.168.0.8:5000` (on my laptop). That way my phone can access the project with the IP address.

`npx serve --ssl`- for ssl certificate but Chrome won't like the certificate.

Here's instructions for port forwarding to access localhost:8000 on my phone - https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging/local-server
